&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#ff4800&gt;Medical Expansion&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Contains a variety of Cyborg &amp; Android Prosthetics, Artificial Body Parts &amp; Weapons, Transformations, Transplantations, Neural Chips, Fusions and Enhancements.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#ffa800&gt;Details&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
This mod lets you create your own cyborgs and super soldiers. Make specialized squads with combat chips controlled by an artifical intelligence or let your bruisers go outta control with energy fists and outer blades made of titanium. Enhance their agility with advanced musclewire or give em a cyclops visor for more precision.

You can use eye piercing neuromods to transfer the brain structure and enhance their skill levels or brainwash their passions to restart from zero. Shield them in exoskeleton armors or with Dermalplatings fused directly with the body.
